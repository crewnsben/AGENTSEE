Speaker 1: Mike was not in the mood today, was in no mood today.
Speaker 2: I didn't notice.
Speaker 1: I think that's good.
Speaker 2: No shit. That's good.
Speaker 1: He was fucking pissed dude.
Speaker 2: What was he pissed about?
Speaker 1: You really didn't notice?
Speaker 2: Why you never like, like wow Mike's in a really bad mood.
Speaker 1: It's like, is he?
Speaker 2: I just think of him as broken.
Speaker 1: Look, I've had enough of this, John. You can't keep undermining me in meetings!
Speaker 2: Undermining you? I'm just stating facts, Sarah. Your proposal is full of holes and you know it.
Speaker 1: Oh, please! You're not even in my department. What gives you the right to critique my work?
Speaker 2: We're all on the same team here. If I see a problem, I'm going to point it out.
Speaker 1: There's a way to do that without making me look incompetent in front of everyone!
Speaker 2: Maybe if you did your job properly, I wouldn't have to say anything!
Speaker 1: Excuse me? I've been here for five years. You've been here for what, six months?
Speaker 2: Experience doesn't matter if you're not using it effectively.
Speaker 1: That's rich coming from someone who can't even use the copy machine properly.
Speaker 2: At least I can put together a coherent presentation!
Speaker 1: You know what? I'm done with this conversation. I'm going to HR.
Speaker 2: Go ahead! They need to know how you're wasting company resources anyway.
Speaker 1: Unbelievable. You're impossible to work with, you know that?
Speaker 2: Right back at you, Sarah. Right back at you.
