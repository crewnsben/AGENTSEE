I appreciate the opportunity to engage with the panelists. Here are the three questions I would like to propose:

1. How do you see the current trends in our field influencing future research directions?
2. What challenges do you believe researchers will face in the coming years, and how can we prepare for them?
3. In your opinion, what role does interdisciplinary collaboration play in advancing our understanding of complex issues?
