As an architecture critic, it's essential to provide constructive feedback rather than simply trashing a student's project. Every design reflects the unique perspective and effort of the student. Instead of focusing solely on the negatives, I would encourage a dialogue about the strengths of the project, the thought process behind the design choices, and areas for improvement. This approach not only fosters growth but also respects the hard work that goes into each project.
